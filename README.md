# Runrig Open Design Workshops
This is a directory of projects in active development as part of Runrig's Open
Design Workshops, including design documents, event schedules, meeting notes and
general information.

With these workshops, we seek to promote an open culture of design, where
knowledge is produced and shared in collaboration among practitioners from every
level and realm of expertise. Ideally, this should include diverse members of
the broader technological ecosystem, persons involved at all stages of the
supply chain, and the totality of subjects that make up a given foodshed or
bioregion, human and otherwise.

Central to Runrig's design methodology are the social relations and communities
that develop in tandem with the development of any particular technology.
Priority should be given to these relationships over all other performance
indicators or engagement metrics. This is all part of the principle of ["ecology
over architecture"], as outlined in the Runrig Plan.

We would like to encourage multilingual events in the future, for which May First provides a special [Simultaneous Translation] service, so [let us know] if you would like us to find a translator for any languages other than English and we'll try our hardest to arrange that!
