# Runrig Open Design Workshops
This is a directory of projects in active development as part of Runrig's Open
Design Workshops, including design documents, event schedules, meeting notes and
general information.

With these workshops, we seek to promote an open culture of design, where
knowledge is produced and shared in collaboration among practitioners from every
level and realm of expertise. Ideally, this should include diverse members of
the broader technological ecosystem, persons involved at all stages of the
supply chain, and the totality of subjects that make up a given foodshed or
bioregion, human and otherwise.

Central to Runrig's design methodology are the social relations and communities
that develop in tandem with the development of any particular technology.
Priority should be given to these relationships over all other performance
indicators or engagement metrics. This is all part of the principle of ["ecology
over architecture"], as outlined in the Runrig Plan.

## Current Projects
- [Richland Gro-Op Crop Plan Auditing System]

Workshops will often be devoted to the specific projects above, but we can always form breakout rooms to discuss more general topics or hack on something totally new!

## Schedule
Three 1-hour workshops are held each month at varied times of day and days of
the week to provide more opportunities to participate for people coming from
different timezones or who have a recurring obligation that might conflict with
a single time and day of the week.

| N<sup>th</sup> Day of the Month | Office Hours  | Workshop     |
| :------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| First Friday                    | 7:30 - 8am ET | 8am - 9am ET |
| Second Sunday                   | 1:30 - 2pm ET | 2pm - 3pm ET |
| Third Thursday                  | 5:30 - 6pm ET | 6pm - 7pm ET |

Specific dates & times for upcoming events will be posted on the [GOAT Community
Calendar] (via Google Calendar). You can also find all workshops posted in the
[Runrig Workshops Group], which is an instance of the ActivityPub-based
[Mobilizon] social event planner made by [Framasoft] and hosted by [NixNix].

### Jitsi Meet
Unless otherwise noted, workshops and other scheduled events will be held in the following Jitsi room hosted by May First Movement Technology:

We would like to encourage multilingual events in the future, for which May First provides a special [Simultaneous Translation] service, so [let us know] if you would like us to find a translator for any languages other than English and we'll try our hardest to arrange that!

Each workshop session will also be live-streamed and posted afterwards to the
[Runrig YouTube Channel] so people can watch later if they miss it or want to
catch up.
